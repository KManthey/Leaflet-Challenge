Leaflet-Challenge

Purpose: Visualize earthquake data for all earthquakes from the past 7 days.  
Earthquakes will be plotted on a map based on their longitude and latitude.
Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size.  
The depth of the earth quake will be represented by color. 
A ledgend will provide a color key for the depth.
Pop-ups will provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
